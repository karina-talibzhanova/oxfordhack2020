# Productivity... but bad

This browser extension was made for Oxford Digithon 2020 and won Most Creative Hack.

## What does it do?

It aims to stop the user from being productive and gets them back to procrastinating on their favourite sites.

Currently, it can:
* forcefully close the current tab and open a new tab to Facebook
* change the background colour randomly of every element in a Wikipedia page
* remove content from a StackOverflow page

## What's next?

The next steps will involve linking the content script to the background script so that all sites can be affected by its devious methods. There will also be more methods added to really push the user to procrastinating.
